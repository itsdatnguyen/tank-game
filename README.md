# tank-game
An old project that I keep around for nostalgia.

This is a project that I made in Python in grade 9. It was my first real experience at applying programming to make something tangible.
I realize that this code will make most programmers throw up or contemplate suicide, but I keep it around mainly to motivate myself and 
remind me that anything is possible.
